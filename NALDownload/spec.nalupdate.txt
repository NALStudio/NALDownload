00001100: Step Into Directory From Current Directory
00001101: Step Out Of Current Directory To The Previous Directory
00001111: Create and Step Into Directory From Current Directory
11111100: Delete File

INSTRUCTION_SEPARATOR (const): 10101010
// Byte 10101010 is replaced with 10101010 10101010 on all instruction bodies.
// Instruction type cannot be equal to INSTRUCTION_SEPARATOR

HEADER EXAMPLE:

^ spec version (big endian)

INSTRUCTION EXAMPLES:
INSTRUCTION:
00000000 (00000000 00000000)
^ type   ^ (optional) body

WRITE GZIP/VCDIFF INSTRUCTION EXAMPLE:
00000001 10110000 11111100 00111100
^ type   ^ body (GZIP/VCDIFF)

VERIFY HASH INSTRUCTION EXAMPLE:
00000010 10110000 11111100 00111100
^ type   ^ body (hash)

STEP IN/OPEN/CREATE&OPEN/DELETE INSTRUCTION EXAMPLE:
00000100 00010111 10100000 11100011 00010110 01000011
^ type   ^ body start directory/file (UTF-8)
Validation of opened/deleted directory/file type recommended. On creation, validate that the file does not exist.
On directory creation, verify that the directory doesn't exist and it's parent exists. This behaviour might change later.

STEP OUT/CLOSE INSTRUCTION EXAMPLE:
00000101
^ type
Instruction separator byte could be removed, but we will keep it in the spec to make parsing a bit clearer.
Validation of closed directory/file type and/or name recommended.
